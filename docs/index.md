# üëãWelcome to '#WithBeer üç∫'!

**Oi** (Olympiad in Informatics) originated in 1984 in China. It is one of the five high school discipline competitions.

**ICPC** (International Collegiate Programming Contest), organized by ICPC foundation, is the most influential computer contest for college students. Because ACM sponsored this competition in the past, many people used to call it ACM competition.

**Oi wiki** is committed to becoming a free, open and continuously updated knowledge integration site of competitive programming. You can get interesting and practical knowledge related to the competition here. We have prepared the basic knowledge, common question types, problem-solving ideas and common tools in the competition to help you learn the knowledge involved in the programming competition more quickly and deeply.

Inspired by **CTF wiki,** this project has consulted many materials in the preparation process, and I would like to thank you at the same time.
